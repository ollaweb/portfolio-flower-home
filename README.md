### Descroption
Small project to practice HTML, CSS and native JS.
About **CSS**:
* no Bootstrap;
* BEM tecnology in naming classes;
* SASS preprocessor in SCSS syntax.
---
Added slick-slider on jQuery. 
About **native JS**: 
* arrow-up button changes it's color above footer for better vision(because it has footers' color);
* smooth scroll is smart. It calculates the didstance between anchor block and link and does scroll it for fixed duration time (the greater the distance the greater the speed);
* form validation show error messages when you try to enter not allowed symbols and when you try to submit invalid value.
---
About **building the project**:
* Gulp (for everything else) + Webpack (for js files);
